NTP 4.2.8
        originals can be found on http://www.ntp.org/downloads.html

Import
------

For the import of NTP the following files were removed:

        ports/*             NT files
        html/pic/*          GIF files
        html/build/hints/solaris.xtra.4095849 Trigger merge conflict script

The stripped down version was created using FREEBSD-Xlist during
extraction:

        tar -X FREEBSD-Xlist -xvzf ntp-4.2.8.tar.gz
        mv ntp-4.2.8 4.2.8

Updating usr.sbin/ntp
---------------------

./configure --disable-all-clocks --enable-NMEA --enable-ONCORE
--enable-RAWDCF --with-crypto --disable-debugging
--enable-LOCAL-CLOCK --with-sntp --with-arlib --prefix=/usr

config.h was generated by running configure and excluding almost all clock
drivers (what is included is DCF77 -- what I use --, NMEA, Motorola OnCORE
and local clocks).

The file is then edited to edit the value of "NO_PARENB_IGNPAR" because we
need to set no parity on the serial port (needed for DCF77). All clock
drivers are then disabled (some of them are included by default by ntpd).

Note that there are two #ifdef to support other architectures (WRT to long
size and endianness). They'll need to be redone for each upgrade to the
vendor branch to keep config.h in sync.

ntpd/ntp_control.c is now the only file that is different from the vendor
branch for unsigned char/int fixes and removal of a DoS.

Documentation in /usr/share/doc/ntp is generated from the HTML files with
lynx (without the GIF files of course).

A patch to fix IPV6_MULTICAST_LOOP was committed to head as r222444 and
filed as http://bugs.ntp.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1936.  Check if still needed
or re-apply on update.
