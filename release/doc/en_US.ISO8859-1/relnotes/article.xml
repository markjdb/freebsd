  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This document contains the release notes for &os;
    &release.current;.  It describes recently added, changed, or
    deleted features of &os;.  It also provides some notes on
    upgrading from previous versions of &os;.</para>

  <para releasetype="current">The &release.type; distribution to which
    these release notes apply represents the latest point along the
    &release.branch; development branch since &release.branch; was

    distributions along this branch can be found at <uri

  <para releasetype="snapshot">The &release.type; distribution to

  <para>All users are encouraged to consult the release errata before

    information on known bugs, security advisories, and corrections to
    documentation.  An up-to-date copy of the errata for &os;

  <title>What's New</title>

  <para>This section describes the most user-visible new or changed
    features in &os; since &release.prev;.  In general, changes
    described here are unique to the &release.branch; branch unless
    specifically marked as &merged; features.</para>

  <para>Typical release note items document recent security advisories
    issued after &release.prev;, new drivers or hardware support, new
    commands or options, major bug fixes, or contributed software
    upgrades.  They may also list changes to major ports/packages or
    release engineering practices.  Clearly the release notes cannot
    list every single change made to &os; between releases; this
    document focuses primarily on security advisories, user-visible
    changes, and major architectural improvements.</para>
