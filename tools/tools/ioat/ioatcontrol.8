.Dt IOATCONTROL 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm ioatcontrol
.Nd Userspace tool to test
.Xr ioat 4
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl V
.Ar channel_number
.Ar num_txns
.Ar [ bufsize
.Ar [ chain-len
.Ar [ duration ] ] ]
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
allows one to issue some number of test operations to the
.Xr ioat 4
driver on a specific hardware channel.
The arguments are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl V
Verify copies for accuracy
.El
.Pp
.Nm
operates in one of two modes; if the
.Ar duration
argument is passed,
.Nm
tries to estimate the copy rate in bytes per second by running
.Ar num_txns
repeatedly in loop.
If
.Ar duration
is not passed,
.Nm
only runs through
.Ar num_txns
once and prints the total bytes copied, as well as error information.
.Pp
The
.Ar bufsize
argument determines the size of buffers to use for each
.Fn ioat_copy
invocation.
The default is 256 KB.
.Pp
The
.Ar chain-len
argument determines the number of copies to chain together in a single DMA
transaction.
The default is 1, and the maximum is currently 4.
.Pp
The
.Ar duration
argument specifies an approximate time limit for the test, in milliseconds.
.Pp
The test will allocate two chunks of memory for each component of each
transaction's chain.
It will initialize them with specific data patterns.
During the test, it submits DMA requests to copy between pairs of buffers.
If the
.Fl V
flag was specified, it will compare the contents in the callback for a copy
error.
.Sh FILES
.Pa /dev/ioat_test
.Pp
The interface between
.Nm
and
.Xr ioat 4 .
.Nm
exposes it with
.Cd hw.ioat.enable_ioat_test=1 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
The wait channel
.Va test_submit
indicates that the test code is keeping the DMA engine full of work.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Xr ioat 4
driver first appeared in
.Fx 11.0 .
