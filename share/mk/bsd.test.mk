# Generic build infrastructure for test programs.
#
# The code in this file is independent of the implementation of the test
# programs being built; this file just provides generic infrastructure for the
# build and the definition of various helper variables and targets.
#
# Makefiles should never include this file directly.  Instead, they should
# include one of the various *.test.mk depending on the specific test programs
# being built.

# Pointer to the top directory into which tests are installed.  Should not be
# overriden by Makefiles, but the user may choose to set this in src.conf(5).
TESTSBASE?= /usr/tests

# Directory in which to install tests defined by the current Makefile.
# Makefiles have to override this to point to a subdirectory of TESTSBASE.

# Makefiles built into the FreeBSD src tree.

# List of subdirectories containing tests into which to recurse.  This has the
# same semantics as SUBDIR at build-time.  However, the directories listed here
# get registered into the run-time test suite definitions so that the test
# engines know to recurse into these directories.
#
# In other words: list here any directories that contain test programs but use
# SUBDIR for directories that may contain helper binaries and/or data files.

# TESTSDIR.

# If 'auto', a Kyuafile is automatically generated based on the list of test
# programs built by the Makefile and is installed into TESTSDIR.  This is the
# default and is sufficient in the majority of the cases.
#
# If 'no', no Kyuafile is installed.
