/*
 * FUSE File Handles
 *
 * The FUSE protocol says that a server may assign a unique 64-bit file handle
 * every time that a file is opened.  Effectively, that's once for each file
 * descriptor.
 *
 * Unfortunately, the VFS doesn't help us here.  VOPs don't have a
 * struct file* argument.  fileops do, but many syscalls bypass the fileops
 * layer and go straight to a vnode.  Some, like writing from cache, can't
 * track a file handle even in theory.  The entire concept of the file handle
 * is a product of FUSE's Linux origins; Linux lacks vnodes and almost every
 * file system operation takes a struct file* argument.
 *
 * Since FreeBSD's VFS is more file descriptor-agnostic, we must store FUSE
 * filehandles in the vnode.  One option would be to only store a single file
 * handle and never open FUSE files concurrently.  That's what NetBSD does.
 * But that violates FUSE's security model.  FUSE expects the server to do all
 * authorization (except when mounted with -o default_permissions).  In order
 * to do that, the server needs us to send FUSE_OPEN every time somebody opens
 * a new file descriptor.
 *
 * Another option would be to never open FUSE files concurrently, but send a
 * FUSE_ACCESS prior to every open after the first.  That would give the server
 * the opportunity to authorize the access.  Unfortunately, the FUSE protocol
 * makes ACCESS optional.  File systems that don't implement it are assumed to
 * authorize everything.  A survey of 32 fuse file systems showed that only 14
 * implemented access.  Among the laggards were a few that really ought to be
 * doing server-side authorization.
 *
 * So we do something hacky, similar to what OpenBSD, Illumos, and OSXFuse do.
 * we store a list of file handles, one for each combination of vnode, uid,
 * gid, pid, and access mode.  When opening a file, we first check whether
 * there's already a matching file handle.  If so, we reuse it.  If not, we
 * send FUSE_OPEN and create a new file handle.  That minimizes the number of
 * open file handles while still allowing the server to authorize stuff.
 *
 * VOPs that need a file handle search through the list for a close match.
 * They can't be guaranteed of finding an exact match because, for example, a
 * process may have changed its UID since opening the file.  Also, most VOPs
 * don't know exactly what permission they need.  Is O_RDWR required or is
 * O_RDONLY good enough?  So the file handle we end up using may not be exactly
 * the one we're supposed to use with that file descriptor.  But if the FUSE
 * file system isn't too picky, it will work.  (FWIW even Linux sometimes
 * guesses the file handle, during writes from cache or most SETATTR
 * operations).
 *
 * I suspect this mess is part of the reason why neither NFS nor 9P have an
 * equivalent of FUSE file handles.
