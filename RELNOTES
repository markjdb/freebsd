Release notes for FreeBSD 16.0.

This file describes new user-visible features, changes and updates relevant to
users of binary FreeBSD releases.  Each entry should describe the change in no
more than several sentences and should reference manual pages where an
interested user can find more information.  Entries should wrap after 80
columns.  Each entry should begin with one or more commit IDs on one line,
specified as a comma separated list and/or range, followed by a colon and a
newline.  Entries should be separated by a newline.

Changes to this file should not be MFCed.

af099eaa5ec:
	Users belonging to the new vmm group can now create bhyve VMs.  See the
	vmm(4) man page for details.

c71354030a2:
	Users wishing to use bhyve PCI passthrough in jails must create the
	jail with the allow.vmm_ppt option configured.

4d707825bf62:
	The pdwait(2) system call was added.  It provides wait(2)-like
	functionality for a process descriptor (see procdesc(4)).

5c2ee618d5ec:
	The pdrfork(2) system call was added.  It behaves like rfork(2) but
	additionally returns a process descriptor (see procdesc(4)).

41ccf82b29f3, 591c7a08bf8a:
	On arm64, memcpy(3), memmove(3) and memset(3) are now implemented using
	the MOPS (Memory Operations) feature instructions when they are
	implemented by the system.

3f0aea09689f:
	posix_spawnattr_getexecfd_np(3) and posix_spawnattr_setexecfd_np(3)
	functions were added to libc.  The latter causes posix_spawn(3) to
	call fexecve(2) on the specified file descriptor rather than executing
	the file at the provided path.

fb4b0c911951:
	witness(4) now prints additional information to the system console when
	a lock order reversal is detected, making debugging such issues easier.

1322760fd127:
	It is now possible to compile both the 4BSD and ULE schedulers into the
	same kernel.  The scheduler is selectable at boot-time using a tunable.
	See the SCHEDULERS section of the tuning(7) man page for details.

627e126dbb07:
	The default value of the net.inet6.ip6.connect_in6addr_wild has changed
	to 0.  This means that connecting to the all-zeroes IPv6 address no longer
	implicitly results in a loopback connection.

afa70a8496e9:
	The pthread_tryjoin_np(3) function was added to libthr(3).  It provides
	the same functionality as pthread_join(3) but returns instead of
	blocking if the target thread has not yet exited.

ecc039be7fdd:
	NanoBSD images can now be built as a non-root user.

7f54c65abc67:
        Update smartpqi(4) to vendor version 14.4690.0.2008 - 15.2.0.2008
        for the SmartArray storage controllers.  This adds support for new 
        controllers, adds code that utilizes the new BIG_IOCTL_Command_struct
        and allows the I/O buffer size for a single passthrough ioctl to be
        stored as a 32 bit integer instead of the original 16 bit integer.

b0d997095022:
	The pf firewall now supports passing IPv6 packets to divert(4)
	sockets via divert-to actions.

0fa7b3bee72e, c71f18998e0b, 4162a419a475, f5a77dc8f8df:
	LinuxKPI based wireless drivers, especially iwlwifi(4) are now
	supported on RISC-V.

8254b0dec02b3, bd55cbb50c588:
	The mac(4) framework has been extended to support jail operations,
	allowing a policy to constrain jail creation, modification, removal, and
	attachment.  Jails have additionally been made a first-class mac(4)
	object, and a mac.label jail(8) property has been added to facilitate
	administration of their labels.

c558eca47970:
	The smartpqi(4) driver was updated to vendor version 4660.0.2002
	for the SmartArry storage controllers.

493d26c58e73:
	The aq(4) driver was added, imported from the vendor repository.
	This provides support for Aquantia / Marvell PCIe 1/2.5/5/10 Gigabit
	Ethernet adapters (AQC107, AQC108, AQC109, AQC111, AQC112).

1a7151f79664:
	A new CAM provider was added to dtrace.  This enables tracing of I/O
	requests through the CAM layer without relying on fragile function
	boundary tracing.  See dtrace_cam(4) for details.

b8c99e7d912f:
	The tdestroy(3) function was added to libc.  The tdestroy() function
	destroys a whole search tree, freeing all allocated nodes.

4bf8ce037dc8:
	The rge(4) driver was added, ported from OpenBSD.  This provides
	support for RealTek RTL8125, RTL8126 and RTL8127 PCIe Ethernet
	controllers.

cbc6f7e941e4:
	bhyve(8)'s VNC device can now listen on a unix(4) socket for VNC client
	connections.

39ee24182b92:
	An rc(8) service can now be started as a specific user for auditing
	purposes by setting the <service>_audit_user rc.conf(5) variable.

dcb0790bad43:
	A setaudit(8) utility was added to the base system.  This provides a
	simple command-line wrapper for the setaudit(2) and setaudit_addr(2)
	system calls.

8e3fd450cc53, 949cff4dceff, 0e724de9ed6f, 9f49f436a9ec, e35191ccf3b3:
	Add support for an extension to NFSv4.2 (RFCnnnn) that
	supports handling of POSIX draft ACLs via getfacl(1)/setfacl(1).

dbac191956f9, fe21dbf70aa8:
	Support for the kcmp(2) system call and fcntl(F_DUPFD_QUERY) for Linux
	binaries.

a86dc94b84d1:
	tzdata2025c was imported.

a98e5d785001:
	Add strdupa(3) and strndupa(3) macros for compatability with glibc.

e967a2a03677:
	divert socket compat removal, consumers must use PF_DIVERT instead of
	PF_INET.

4453ec5b8716b, 2a3b1641756a:
	The reboot(8) and halt(8) commands now perform a graceful shutdown similar
	to the shutdown(8) command including invoking rc.d scripts to shutdown
	services.  The fastboot(8) and fasthalt(8) commands still perform a "fast"
	reboot or shutdown.

d9788eabffa4:
	ipfilter cannot be used in a jail by default.

0ff0c19e7f70:
	ipfs(8) is no longer built by default.

575efcfff22f:
	sendfile(2)'s SF_SYNC flag was removed.

057dae35ffc6, 51a01f3debff, ca3e47b0ea68:
	hwpmc(4) support for Intel Alder Lake 6-B7, 6-BA, and 6-BF CPU
	hwpmc(4) support for Intel Emerald Rapids CPUs
	hwpmc(4) support for Intel Alder Lake-N CPUs

1ecf01065b45:
	New library libuvmem provides the vmem(9) API to userspace applications.

b6cad334e64:
	Make game controller devices accessible by members of the "game" group
	by default.

791c531402bd:
	Add driver for Feature Integration Technology Inc. (aka Fintek) F81232
	USB to serial devices.

ec0cd287f55f:
	Support for NVMe/TCP offload on Chelsio T7 adapters.  The nvmf_che(4)
	module enables T7 adapters to process NVMe/TCP PDUs directly similar to
	the PDU offload provided by cxgbei(4) for iSCSI.
