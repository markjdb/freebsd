.\" $FreeBSD$
Set to build profiled libraries for use with
.Xr gcov 1 ,
.Xr lcov 1 ,
etc.
.Em Warning:
this option is experimental.
Profiled libraries and binaries with runtime instrumentation built in will
consume large amounts of disk space (somewhere on the order of several
gigabytes).
.\" TODO: put this in build(7)?
GCDA files are installed to the
.Pa /usr/lib/cov
prefix.
.\" TODO: verify this claim in an e2e test.
The install directory mirrors the install path for the object directory, e.g.,
.Pa /usr/lib/cov/usr/obj/lib/libc/stdio/vfprintf.gcda
