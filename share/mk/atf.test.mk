# Logic to build and install ATF test programs; i.e. test programs linked

.include <bsd.init.mk>

# List of C, C++ and shell test programs to build.
#
# Programs listed here are built using PROGS, PROGS_CXX and SCRIPTS,
# respectively, from bsd.prog.mk.  However, the build rules are tweaked to
# require the ATF libraries.
#
# Test programs registered in this manner are set to be installed into TESTSDIR
# (which should be overriden by the Makefile) and are not required to provide a
# manpage.

# Whether to allow using the deprecated ATF tools or not.
#
# If 'yes', this file will generate Atffiles when requested and will also
# support using the deprecated atf-run tool to execute the tests.
ALLOW_DEPRECATED_ATF_TOOLS?= no

# Knob to control the handling of the Atffile for this Makefile.
#
# If 'yes', an Atffile exists in the source tree and is installed into
# TESTSDIR.
#
# If 'auto', an Atffile is automatically generated based on the list of test
# programs built by the Makefile and is installed into TESTSDIR.  This is the
# default and is sufficient in the majority of the cases.
#
# If 'no', no Atffile is installed.
